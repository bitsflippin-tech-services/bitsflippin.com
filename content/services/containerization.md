### Containerizing workloads can bring huge benifits to your organisation.

- Improved sandboxing of application and services from the host
- Scalability
- Portablity
- Agility in developer operations
- Integrate with industry leading DevOPS technologies to enhance developer experience.
- Virtualization allows you to deploy, test and run servers in a secure sandboxed environment. We use Proxmox to manage and deploy multiple virtual machines.
